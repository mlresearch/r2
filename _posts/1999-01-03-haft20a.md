abstract: We present a systematic, model-independent formulation of  mean field theory
  (MFT) as an inference method in probabilistic models.  "Model-independent" means
  that we do not assume a particular type of dependency among the variables of a domain
  but instead work in a general probabilistic setting. In a Bayesian network, for
  example, you may use arbitrary tables to specify conditional dependencies and thus
  run MFT in any Bayesian network. Furthermore, the general mean field equations derived
  here shed a light on the essence of MFT. MFT can be interpreted as a <em>local</em>
  iteration scheme which relaxes in a consistent state (a solution of the mean field
  equations). Iterating the mean field equations means propagating information through
  the network. In general, however, there are multiple solutions to the mean field
  equations. We show that improved approximations can  be obtained by forming a weighted
  mixture of the multiple mean field solutions.  Simple approximate expressions for
  the mixture weights are given. The benefits of taking into account multiple solutions
  are demonstrated by using MFT for inference in a small Bayesian network representing
  a medical domain. Thereby it turns out that every solution of the mean field equations
  can be interpreted as a ’disease scenario’.
