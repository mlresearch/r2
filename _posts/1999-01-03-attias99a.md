title: Hierarchical IFA Belief Networks
year: '1999'
url: http://uncertainty99.microsoft.com/attias.htm
abstract: We introduce a new real-valued belief network, which is a multilayer generalization
  of independent factor analysis (IFA). At each level, this network extracts real-valued
  latent variables that are non-linear functions of the input data with a highly adaptive
  functional form, resulting in a hierarchical distributed representation of these
  data. The network is based on a probabilistic generative model, constructed by cascading
  single-layer IFA models. Whereas exact maximum-likelihood learning for this model
  is intractable, we present and demonstrate an algorithm that maximizes a lower bound
  on the likelihood. This algorithm is developed by formulating a variational approach
  to hierarchical IFA networks.
