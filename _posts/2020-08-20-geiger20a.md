title: On the geometry of DAG models with hidden variables
year: '1999'
url: http://uncertainty99.microsoft.com/geiger.htm
abstract: We prove that many graphical models with hidden variables are not curved
  exponential families. This result, together with the fact that some graphical models
  are curved and not linear, implies that the hierarchy of graphical models, as linear,
  curved, and stratified, is non-collapsing; each level in the hierarchy is strictly
  contained in the larger levels. This result is discussed in the context of model
  selection of graphical models.
