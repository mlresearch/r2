abstract: In clinical trials with significant noncompliance the standard intention-to-treat
  analyses sometimes mislead. Rubinâ€™s causal model provides an alternative method
  of analysis that can shed extra light on clinical trial data. Formulating the Rubin
  Causal Model as a Bayesian graphical model facilitates model communication and computation.
