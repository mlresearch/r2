abstract: The Multi-Stream Dependency Detection algorithm finds rules that capture
  statistical dependencies between patterns in multivariate time series of categorical
  data. Rule strength is measured by the G statistic, and an upper bound on the value
  of G for the descendants of a node allows MSDD’s search space to be pruned. However,
  in the worst case, the algorithm will explore exponentially many rules. This paper
  presents and empirically evaluates two ways of addressing this problem. The first
  is a set of three methods for reducing the size of MSDD’s search space based on
  information collected during the search process. Second, we discuss an implementation
  of MSDD that distributes its computations over multiple machines on a network.
