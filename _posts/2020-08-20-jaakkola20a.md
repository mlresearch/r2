abstract: We introduce a class of flexible conditional probability models and techniques
  for classification/regression problems. Many existing methods such as generalized
  linear models and support vector machines are subsumed under this class. The flexibility
  of this class of techniques comes from the use of kernel functions as in support
  vector machines, and the generality from dual formulations of standard regression
  models.
