abstract: We investigate a class of hierarchical mixtures-of-experts (HME) models
  where exponential family regression models with generalized linear mean functions
  of the form $\psi(a+x^T b)$ are mixed. Here $\psi(\cdot)$ is the inverse link function.
  Suppose the true response $y$ follows an exponential family regression model with
  mean function belonging to a class of smooth functions of the form $\psi(h(x))$
  where $h \in W_{2;K_0}^\infty$ (a Sobolev class over $[0,1]^{s}$). It is shown that
  the HME mean functions can approximate the true mean function, at a rate of $O(m^{-2/s})$
  in $L_p$ norm. Moreover, the HME probability density functions can approximate the
  true density, at a rate of $O(m^{-2/s})$ in Hellinger distance, and at a rate of
  $O(m^{-4/s})$ in Kullback-Leibler divergence. These rates can be achieved within
  the family of HME structures with a tree of binary splits, or within the family
  of structures with a single layer of experts. Here $s$ is the dimension of the predictor
  $x$. It is also shown that likelihood-based inference based on HME is consistent
  in recovering the truth, in the sense that as the sample size $n$ and the number
  of experts $m$ both increase, the mean square error of the estimated mean response
  goes to zero. Conditions for such results to hold are stated and discussed.
