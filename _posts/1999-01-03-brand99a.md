title: Pattern Discovery via Entropy Minimization
year: '1999'
url: http://uncertainty99.microsoft.com/brand.htm
abstract: We propose a framework for learning hidden-variable models by optimizing
  entropies, in which entropy minimization, posterior maximization, and free energy
  minimization are all equivalent. Solutions for the maximum <em>a posteriori</em>
  (MAP) estimator yield powerful learning algorithms that combine all the charms of
  expectation-maximization and deterministic annealing. Contained as special cases
  are the methods of maximum entropy, maximum likelihood, and a new method, maximum
  structure. We focus on the maximum structure case, in which entropy minimization
  maximizes the amount of evidence supporting each parameter while minimizing uncertainty
  in the sufficient statistics and cross-entropy between the model and the data. In
  iterative estimation, the MAP estimator gradually extinguishes excess parameters,
  sculpting a model structure that reflects hidden structures in the data. These models
  are highly resistant to over-fitting and have the particular virtue of being easy
  to interpret, often yielding insights into the hidden causes that generate the data.
