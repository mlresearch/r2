title: Causal Mechanisms and Classification Trees for Predicting Chemical Carcinogens
year: '1999'
url: http://uncertainty99.microsoft.com/predchem.htm
abstract: Classification trees, usually used as a nonlinear, nonparametric classification
  method, can also provide a powerful framework for comparing, assessing, and combining
  information from different expert systems, by treating their predictions as the
  independent variables in a classification tree analysis. This paper discusses the
  applied problem of classifying chemicals as human carcinogens. It shows how classification
  trees can be used to compare the information provided by ten different carcinogen
  classification expert systems, construct an improved "hybrid" classification system
  from them, and identify cost-effective combinations of assays (the inputs to the
  expert systems) to use in classifying chemicals in future.
