abstract: The problem of learning the structure of a DAG model in the presence of
  latent variables presents many formidable challenges. In particular there are an
  infinite number of latent variable models to consider, and these models possess
  features which make them hard to work with. We describe a class of graphical models
  which can represent the conditional independence structure induced by a latent variable
  model over the observed margin. We give a parametrization of the set of Gaussian
  distributions with conditional independence structure given by a MAG model. The
  models are illustrated via a simple example. Different estimation techniques are
  discussed in the context of Zellnerâ€™s Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) models.
