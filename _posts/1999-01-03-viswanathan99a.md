abstract: Minimum Message Length (MML) and Structural Risk Minimisation (SRM) are
  two computational learning principles that have achieved wide acclaim in recent
  years. Whereas the former is based on Bayesian learning and the latter on the classical
  theory of VC-dimension, they are similar in their attempt to define a trade-off
  between model complexity and goodness of fit to the data. A recent empirical study
  by Wallace compared the performance of standard model selection methods in a one-dimensional
  polynomial regression framework. The results from this study provided strong evidence
  in support of the MML and SRM based methods over the other standard approaches.
  In this paper we present a detailed empirical evaluation of three model selection
  methods which include an MML based approach and two SRM based methods. Results from
  our analysis and experimental evaluation suggest that the MML-based approach in
  general has higher predictive accuracy and also raise questions on the inductive
  capabilities of the Structural Risk Minimization Principle.
