title: Stochastic Local Search for Bayesian Network
year: '1999'
abstract: The paper evaluates empirically the suitability of Stochastic Local Search
  algorithms (SLS) for finding most probable explanations in Bayesian networks. SLS
  algorithms (e.g., GSAT, WSAT [16]) have recently proven to be highly effective in
  solving complex constraint-satisfaction and satisfiability problems which cannot
  be solved by traditional search schemes. Our experiments investigate the applicability
  of this scheme to probabilistic optimization problems. Specifically, we show that
  algorithms combining hill-climbing steps with stochastic steps (guided by the networkâ€™s
  probability distribution) called <em>G+StS</em>, outperform pure hill-climbing search,
  pure stochastic simulation search, as well as simulated annealing. In addition,
  variants of G+StS that are aug- mented on top of alternative approximation methods
  are shown to be particularly effective.
