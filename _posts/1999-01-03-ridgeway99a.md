abstract: Classification problems have dominated research on boosting to date. The
  application of boosting to regression problems, on the other hand, has received
  little investigation. In this paper we develop a new boosting method for regression
  problems. We cast the regression problem as a classification problem and apply an
  interpretable form of the boosted naïve Bayes classifier. This induces a regression
  model that we show to be expressible as an additive model for which we derive estimators
  and discuss computational issues. We compare the performance of our boosted naïve
  Bayes regression model with other interpretable multivariate regression procedures.
