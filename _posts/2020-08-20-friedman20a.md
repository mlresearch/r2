abstract: Learning Bayesian networks is a central problem for pattern recognition,
  density estimation and classification. In this paper, we propose a new method for
  speeding up the computational process of learning Bayesian network <em>structure</em>.
  This approach uses constraints imposed by the statistics already collected from
  the data to guide the learning algorithm. This allows us to reduce the number of
  statistics collected during learning and thus speed up the learning time. We show
  that our method is capable of learning structure from data more efficiently than
  traditional approaches. Our technique is of particular importance when the size
  of the datasets is large or when learning from incomplete data. The basic technique
  that we introduce is general and can be used to improve learning performance in
  many settings where sufficient statistics must be computed. In addition, our technique
  may be useful for alternate search strategies such as branch and bound algorithms.
