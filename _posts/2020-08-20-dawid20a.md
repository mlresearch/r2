title: 'Conditional products: An alternative approach to conditional independence'
year: '1999'
url: http://uncertainty99.microsoft.com/dawstud.htm
abstract: 'We introduce a new abstract approach to the study of conditional independence,
  founded on a concept analogous to the factorization properties of probabilistic
  independence, rather than the separation properties of a graph. The basic ingredient
  is the "conditional product", which provides a way of combining the basic objects
  under consideration while preserving as much independence as possible. We introduce
  an appropriate axiom system for conditional product, and show how, when these axioms
  are obeyed, they induce a derived concept of conditional independence which obeys
  the usual semi-graphoid axioms. The general structure is used to throw light on
  three specific areas: the familiar probabilistic framework (both the discrete and
  the general case); a set-theoretic framework related to "variation independence";
  and a variety of graphical frameworks.'
