abstract: 'Methods to avoid overfitting fall into two broad categories: data-oriented
  (using separate data for validation) and representation-oriented (penalizing complexity
  in the model). Both have limitations that are hard to overcome. We argue that fully
  adequate model evaluation is only possible if the search process by which models
  are obtained is also taken into account. To this end, we recently proposed a method
  for process-oriented evaluation (POE), and successfully applied it to rule induction
  (Domingos, 1998). However, for the sake of simplicity this treatment made two rather
  artificial assumptions. In this paper the assumptions are removed, and a simple
  formula for model evaluation is obtained. Empirical trials show the new, better-founded
  form of POE to be as accurate as the previous one, while further reducing theory
  sizes.'
