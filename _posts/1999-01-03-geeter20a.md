title: Geometric modeling of a nuclear environment
year: '1999'

abstract: This paper is about the task-directed updating of an incomplete and inaccurate
  geometric model of a nuclear environment, using only robust radiation-resistant
  sensors installed on a robot that is remotely controlled by a human operator. In
  this problem, there are many sources of uncertainty and ambiguity. This paper proposes
  a probabilistic solution under Gaussian assumptions. Uncertainty is reduced with
  an estimator based on a Kalman filter. Ambiguity on the measurement-feature association
  is resolved by running a bank of those estimators in parallel, one for each plausible
  association. The residual errors of these estimators are used for hypothesis testing
  and for the calculation of a probability distribution over the remaining hypotheses.
  The best next sensing action is calculated as a Bayes decision with respect to a
  loss function that takes into account both the uncertainty on the current estimate,
  and the variance/precision required by the task.
