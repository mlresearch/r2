abstract: Model choice is a fundamental activity in the analysis of data sets, an
  activity which has become increasingly more important as computational advances
  enable the fitting of increasingly complex models. Such complexity typically arises
  through hierarchical structure which requires specification at each stage of probabilistic
  mechanisms, mean and dispersion forms, explanatory variables, etc. Nonnested hierarchical
  models introducing random effects may not be handled by classical methods. Bayesian
  approaches using predictive distributions can be used though the FORMAL solution,
  which includes Bayes factors as a special case, can be criticized. It seems natural
  to evaluate model performance by comparing what it predicts with what has been observed.
  Most classical criteria utilize such comparison. We propose a predictive criterion
  where the goal is good prediction of a replicate of the observed data but tempered
  by fidelity to the observed values. We obtain this criterion by minimizing posterior
  loss for a given model and then, for models under consideration, selecting the one
  which minimizes this criterion. For a version of log scoring loss we can do the
  minimization explicitly, obtaining an expression which can be interpreted as a penalized
  deviance criterion. We illustrate its performance with an application to a large
  data set involving residential property transactions.
