abstract: This paper discusses the use of a power law to predict decision tree performance.
  Power laws are fit to learning curves of decision trees trained on data sets from
  the UCI repository. The learning curves are generated by training C4.5 on different
  size training sets. The power law predicts diminishing returns in terms of error
  rate as training set size increase. By characterizing the learning curve with a
  power law, the error rate for a given size training set can be projected. This projection
  can be used in estimating the amount of data needed to achieve an acceptable error
  rate, and the cost effectiveness of further data collection.
