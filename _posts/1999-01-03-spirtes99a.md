title: An experiment in causal discovery using a pneumonia database

abstract: We tested a causal discovery algorithm on a database of pneumonia patients.
  The output of the causal discovery algorithm is a list of statements "A causes B",
  where A and B are variables in the database, and a score indicating the degree of
  confidence in the statement. We compared the output of the algorithm with the opinions
  of physicians about whether A caused B or not. We found that the doctors opinions
  were independent of the output of the algorithm. However, an examination of the
  output of results suggested a simple, well motivated modification of the algorithm
  which would bring the output of the algorithm into high agreement with the physicians
  opinions.
